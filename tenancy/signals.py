tenancy.signals
===============
Auto-provision a tenant's schema the moment its Company row is created through
the admin (business rule #18 — everything controlled from the admin panel).

The handler is idempotent: ``provision_schema`` skips work if the schema already
has tables, so the two-step Company.save() (which emits post_save twice) cannot
double-provision.
